## Least Square & Minimum Norm Solution (Linear Discriminant Model on IRIS Dataset)

1. To Implement a Linear Discriminant Model to Classify the Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor & Iris Virginica based on the Features- Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length & Petal Width (cm) of the Flowers.

2. Exploring the possibilities of using the Least Square Solution (or Pseudo Inverse Solution) in Lower Dimension (with Less no. of Weights in the Linear Model) as,

  & in Higher Dimension (including Squared Input Features too) as,

  </p>

3. Also checking if the Minimum Norm Solution gives Accurate results for n = 12 Data Points in Lower Dimension (i.e, with Less No. of Weights) and also with n = 25 Data Points in Higher Dimension i.e, including Squared Input Features too.

  </p>

4. Finally, we analyse the Iris Dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis & explore other different Techniques to Classify the IRIS Dataset with Higher Accuracy & obtain better Results.
